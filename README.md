## API Rate Limiting and Caching

### Rate Limiting

The server implements intelligent rate limiting to respect Sleeper API guidelines:

- **Rate Limit**: Follows Sleeper's documented rate limits
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s) for rate-limited requests
- **Queue Management**: Requests are queued during rate limit periods
- **User Feedback**: Clear messages when rate limits are encountered

### Caching Strategy

Different data types have optimized cache TTL values:

| Data Type | Cache TTL | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Player Data | 1 hour | Relatively static during season |
| League Settings | 24 hours | Rarely change mid-season |
| Draft Data | 24 hours | Historical data, doesn't change |
| Matchup Data (active) | 5 minutes | Real-time scoring updates |
| Matchup Data (completed) | 1 hour | Historical data is stable |
| Trending Players | 30 minutes | Updated frequently |
| Roster Data | 15 minutes | Changes with transactions |
| Roster Data (with draft) | 15 minutes | Changes with transactions |

**Cache Features:**
- In-memory caching for optimal performance
- TTL-based expiration
- Automatic cache invalidation
- Cache hit/miss logging for monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Server Won't Start

**Symptoms:**
- Claude Desktop shows "Server unavailable" error
- No response from MCP tools

**Solutions:**
- Verify Python installation: `python --version` (should be 3.8+)
- Check package installation: `pip show sleeper-mcp-server`
- Verify Claude Desktop configuration syntax
- Check logs for specific error messages

#### 2. Authentication/API Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "API request failed" errors
- "Invalid league ID" messages

**Solutions:**
- Verify league IDs are correct (18-character strings)
- Check username spelling and case sensitivity
- Ensure Sleeper API is accessible from your network
- Try again after a few minutes (may be temporary API issues)

#### 3. Rate Limiting Issues

**Symptoms:**
- "Rate limit exceeded" messages
- Slow response times
- "Please wait" messages

**Solutions:**
- Wait for the specified retry period
- Reduce frequency of requests
- Use cached data when possible
- Check if multiple instances are running

#### 4. Cache Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Stale data being returned
- Inconsistent results

**Solutions:**
- Restart the MCP server to clear cache
- Adjust `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` environment variable
- Check system memory availability

#### 5. Configuration Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Tools not appearing in Claude Desktop
- Environment variables not working

**Solutions:**
- Validate JSON syntax in Claude Desktop config
- Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes
- Check file permissions on config file
- Verify environment variable names and values

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed troubleshooting:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sleeper": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "sleeper_mcp_server"],
      "env": {
        "LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check Logs**: Enable DEBUG logging to see detailed error information
2. **Verify Configuration**: Ensure Claude Desktop MCP configuration is correct
3. **Test API Access**: Verify you can access Sleeper API directly
4. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all packages are up to date
5. **Restart Services**: Try restarting both the MCP server and Claude Desktop

### Performance Optimization

#### For Large Leagues
- Use position filtering in player searches
- Cache frequently accessed league data
- Limit historical matchup queries

#### For Multiple Leagues
- Batch similar requests when possible
- Use appropriate cache TTL settings
- Monitor rate limit usage

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (schema validation + regression)
python run_tests.py

# Run only schema validation (no server needed)
python run_tests.py --type schema

# Run only regression tests (requires server running)
python run_tests.py --type regression

# Run with verbose output
python run_tests.py --verbose

# Run against different server
python run_tests.py --server http://localhost:8080

# Run individual validation script
python validate_against_schemas.py

# Run individual regression test
python tests/regression_test.py --verbose
```

### Test Types

1. **Schema Validation** - Validates all tools against their declared JSON schemas
2. **Regression Tests** - Tests actual API calls against expected response formats
3. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end testing with real Sleeper API data

### Test Configuration

Tests can be configured via command line arguments or environment variables:

```bash
# Set server URL for regression tests
export SLEEPER_TEST_SERVER="http://localhost:8000"

# Enable verbose test output
export TEST_VERBOSE="true"

# Run tests against production-like server
python run_tests.py --server https://your-server.com
```

**Note**: This MCP server is not officially affiliated with Sleeper. It's a third-party integration that uses Sleeper's public API.

#### HTTP Transport Mode

For more robust deployment, use the `sleeper_mcp_server` module directly:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Start HTTP server on default port 8000
python -m sleeper_mcp_server.multi_transport_server http

# Start HTTP server on custom host and port
python -m sleeper_mcp_server.multi_transport_server http 0.0.0.0 8080

# Start both MCP and HTTP simultaneously
python -m sleeper_mcp_server.multi_transport_server both 0.0.0.0 8000
```

#### HTTP API Endpoints

When running in HTTP mode, the server provides these REST endpoints:

- **Health Check**: `GET /health`
- **Server Info**: `GET /info`
- **List Tools**: `GET /tools`
- **Call Tool**: `POST /tools/{tool_name}`
- **Batch Tool Calls**: `POST /tools/batch`

#### Example HTTP Usage

```bash
# List available tools
curl http://localhost:8000/tools

# Call a specific tool
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tools/get_user_leagues \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"arguments": {"username": "your_username", "season": "2024"}}'

# Batch tool calls
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tools/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tool_calls": [
      {
        "name": "get_user_leagues",
        "arguments": {"username": "user1", "season": "2024"}
      },
      {
        "name": "get_league_info", 
        "arguments": {"league_id": "123456"}
      }
    ]
  }'
```

#### ADK Integration

For ADK (Agent Development Kit), you can configure the server as an HTTP tool:

```python
# ADK configuration example
from adk import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="fantasy_football_agent",
    tools=[
        {
            "name": "sleeper_api",
            "type": "http",
            "base_url": "http://localhost:8000",
            "endpoints": {
                "list_tools": "/tools",
                "call_tool": "/tools/{tool_name}",
                "batch_call": "/tools/batch"
            }
        }
    ]
)
```

#### LangChain Integration

For LangChain, you can create a custom tool:

```python
from langchain.tools import BaseTool
import requests

class SleeperTool(BaseTool):
    name = "sleeper_api"
    description = "Access to Sleeper Fantasy Football API"
    base_url = "http://localhost:8000"
    
    def _run(self, tool_name: str, arguments: dict):
        response = requests.post(
            f"{self.base_url}/tools/{tool_name}",
            json={"arguments": arguments}
        )
        return response.json()
    
    def _arun(self, tool_name: str, arguments: dict):
        # Async version
        pass
```

#### Transport Mode Summary

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `stdio` | MCP protocol via stdio | Claude Desktop |
| `http` | HTTP REST API | ADK, LangChain, custom agents |
| `both` | Both MCP and HTTP | Hybrid setups, development |
